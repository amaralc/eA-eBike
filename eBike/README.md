# The design of an electric bike

Electric bikes were once a dream, since alternatives to go to school were feet
[50min, R$0.00], bike [16min, R$0.00], bus [15min, R$3.00] or car [9min, R$2.51].
I didn’t have a car but eventually mom would give me a ride. She had plans
so fortunately I lived close from the University (3.8km away), but if I
lived with my father (11.8km away) then this would be a 
whole different story. The pairs would become 
[117min, R$0.00] for going by feet,
[41min, R$0.00] by bike,
[51min, R$3.00] for the
bus ride , and
[20min, R$7.78] if I
had car, but as I didn’t
have one, then it doesn’t
quite matter right?
